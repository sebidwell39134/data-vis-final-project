Graph coloring is a classic problem in graph theory and computational complexity theory.  Most investigation of this problem has focused on the traditional definition of finding the minimum number of colors required to color a graph, its so-called chromatic number, the finding of which is an NP-hard problem; however, the currently-best-known algorithms for performing this are equivalent to finding ways to color a graph relatively quickly asymptotically, and then showing a valid coloring with the appropriate amount of colors to prove that this is indeed the chromatic number.  In my Master's thesis at Wesleyan University, I proposed a fundamentally different reduction of the problem to a search problem on the set of spanning trees of the graph; in this project, I analyze the complete set of spanning trees of the Petersen Graph (which is well known to be 3-colorable) to help visualize what conditions might optimize the behavior of such an algorithm.
