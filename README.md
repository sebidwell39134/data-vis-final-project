Graph coloring is a classic problem in graph theory and computational complexity theory.  Most investigation of this problem has focused on the traditional definition of finding the minimum number of colors required to color a graph, its so-called chromatic number, the finding of which is an NP-hard problem.  In my Master's thesis at Wesleyan University, I proposed a reduction of the problem to a search problem on the set of spanning trees of the graph; in this project, I analyze the complete set of spanning trees of several well-known graphs to help visualize what conditions might optimize the behavior of such an algorithm.  Having no algorithm to compare against, I instead consider in broad strokes the statistical behavior of the set as a whole, and identify non-global local minima (relative to the connectedness of the set of spanning trees) of the deviation from the known chromatic number of the graphs under consideration, which are points of concern for any algorithm attempting to find a true global minimum.
